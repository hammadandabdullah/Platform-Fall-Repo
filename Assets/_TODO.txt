- make player movement as smooth as possible (includes jumping as well)
- decrease shaking of platforms and make it as smooth as possible
- if any animation or sound required to add. add that as well
- bots for first mode (13 bots + 2 players without network lag)
- Fix: bot sticking to the edge of platform or any other wierd movmenet behaviour
- Camera up/down as well
- you'll lose when hit down limit but will only win when 5 people left, including bots
- if player is standing on ground bot keeps getting into the player
- earth quake sound for platform
